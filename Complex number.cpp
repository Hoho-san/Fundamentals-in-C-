/*Make a program to Add Complex Numbers by Passing Structure to a Function.
This program tons.
In this program, two complex numbers entered by the user are stored in the
structures. The two structures are passed a function which calculates the sum
and returns the result to the main function. This result is stored in the structure .
Then, the sign of the imaginary part of the sum is determinedakes two complex numbers as structures and adds them with the
use of functi and stored in
the variable.*/
